## Harvest Test

* A single html test file should be created for each class, e.g. "profile" or "control"
* Input data should be an inline array of objects following usual specifications of a harvest collection.
* Each test should be exclusive to the function tested, i.e. to the extent possible, the test should not include additional functions.
* Each test should be exhaustive of the parameters, inputs, and outputs to the function tested.

## Outputs & Reporting

* A test can be configured and represented in five possible forms:
    1.] Console.log div - when the output format is important to see, i.e. JSON.stringify.
    2.] Mocha test - to run successive tests for several conditions.
    3.] QUnit - alternative to Mocha.
    4.] Table - to see data output clearly.
    5.] Rendered View - for layouts.
